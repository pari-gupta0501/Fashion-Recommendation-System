# 🛍️ Image-Based Product Recommendation System

An AI-powered system that recommends visually similar products based on the image uploaded by the user. This project uses deep learning and computer vision to extract visual features and return similar items from a product dataset, enabling a seamless and intelligent shopping experience.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This system is designed to power **visual search** in e-commerce or fashion platforms. By uploading an image of a product (e.g., clothing, accessories, footwear, electronics), users can discover similar items from a pre-loaded catalog. The system leverages **CNN-based feature extraction** and **similarity matching** to find and display top product recommendations.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📷 Upload a product image from your device
- 🧠 Extract deep visual features using pretrained CNN models (like VGG16 or ResNet50)
- 🔗 Compare image embeddings using Cosine Similarity
- 🎯 Return top-N visually similar product images
- 🖼️ Clean and responsive UI using Streamlit or Flask
- 🧾 (Optional) Display product name, price, brand, and other metadata

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-product-recommender.git

cd image-product-recommender

```
---

2. **Install dependencies**

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
---
3. **Run the app**

```

If using Streamlit: streamlit run app.py

If using Flask: python app.py


```
---

## 🧪 How It Works

User uploads an image of a product.

The app uses a pretrained CNN (like VGG16 or ResNet50) to extract feature embeddings.

These embeddings are compared with precomputed embeddings from the dataset.

The system finds the most similar products using cosine similarity.

Recommendations are displayed with optional metadata (e.g., name, price).
